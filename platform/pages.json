The sapwood is pinkish white and together provides a beautiful contrast. The photo at right shows a Tiki with lots of outer sapwood with the lighter color dominating the Tiki and the neck is a combination of dark & lightwood laminated to form a beautiful Tiki. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Samanea saman</b> \r\n<br>\r\nAlso called ohai by Hawaiians was introduced to the islands in the 1800s. Native to South America, this large tree reaches a height of eighty feet or more with a beautiful, thin, spreading, symmetrical crown. The most prized of this wood is the light yellow with swirling dramatic grain patterns. The Tiki in the photo is made of monkeypod wood and book matched with the softer sapwood located in the middle of the Tiki that provides a nice contrasting statue. The wood is very porous and grain filling is necessary to provide highlighting of the grain pores as well as a leveling medium for the lacquer finish that is hand polished to a high glossy protective finish.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Other wood</b> \r\n<br>\r\nOther local wood used occasionally includes Kamani, Keawe, Macadamia Nut, and Hao. International woods include Purple Heart, Maple, Rosewood, Ebony, Walnut, and Redwood Generally, the back and sides are made of a sturdy hardwood for strength and aesthetics and the top is made with one of the tone woods that are used in the acoustic guitar industry such as Redwood, Western Red Cedar, Sitka or Engleman Spruce.",
      "description" : "<b>Acacia Koa</b> \r\n<br>\r\nIs indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands. It has a beautiful grain whose colors range from blonde to deep chocolate brown with deep reddish brown the most common color. The grades of Koa wood are Select - with very little or no figure and Curly whose figure can vary from slightly wavy, appearing sporadic ally, to a very tight curl over the entire surface providing a three dimensional look when finished to a high gloss. Much of the Koa trees in the past were harvested with little or no attention to reforestation and resource management. Thankfully, the growers are now carefully replanting and managing the harvesting of Koa to ensure a long-term supply of this beautiful wood.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Mango wood</b>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mangifera Indicia) is a beautiful light colored wood with touches of gray & brown grain providing very nice grain patterns. It is also available as figured or curly wood. The Mango tree is an evergreen tree of the Sumac family and a favorite fruit tree in Hawaii with many varieties of mango. It was imported to the islands in the 1800s. The ukulele in the photo at right is made of curly mango and book matched to provide a symmetrical design. It is bound with koa wood for protection and the neck is made of koa & mango wood in a three piece laminated pattern. Sometimes there is a high degree of spalting resulting in a very attractive black grain pattern. Spalting is a result of fungi entering the sapwood. ",

With a small, guitar-shaped body that is fitted with four strings, it is considered a member of the chordophone family. Sound is produced through these instruments by plucking and strumming the strings. The strings in turn vibrate and are amplified by the resonating body. The ukulele is manufactured in a similar way as a full size guitar.\r\n\r\n",

The sap is commonly used to sweeten herbal preparations and the juice from the shoot is used to treat lacerations. The plants in the garden are the Hawaiian medicinal varieties kea, honua'ula, and manulele mentioned in Kaaiakamanu and Akina's Hawaiian Herbs of Medicinal Value and inOutline of Hawaiian Physical Therapeutics by Handy, Pukui and Livermore (1934). \n<br><br>\n<b>Mamaki: Urticacceae</b>\n<br>\nNettle Family: An endemic Hawaiian plant, mamaki ranges in size from a shrub to a small tree and has been divided into as many as 10 species. The inner part of the fruit is used to treat thrush and to cure general debility. The leaves are sold as tea in Hawaii and an infusion made from the leaves is used to treat generalized weakenss. \n<br><br>\n<b>Noni (Indian Mulberry)/Rubiaceae</b>\n<br>\nCoffee family: This small evergreen tree is a Polynesian introduction which has become naturalized in Hawaii. It is considered to have been originally native from southeastern Asia to Australia. The leaves and bark are prepared as a tonic, and to treat urinary disorders and muscle and joint pain. Either the ripe fruit or the leaves can be used as a poultice for boils, wounds and fractures. A tonic prepared from the immature fruit is used to treat diabetes, high blood pressure and loss of appetite. \n<br><br>\n<b>Ohi'a lehua/Myrtaceae</b>\n<br>\nMyrtle family: This plant is native only to Hawaii; closely related plants are native to many areas of Polynesia. It it extremely variable in size and shape, and has a large ecological range. The flower is used to ease childbirth and leaf bud tea is used as a tonic and to treat colds. \n<br><br>\n<b>Olena (Turmeric)/Zingiberaceae</b>\n<br>\nGinger family: This Polynesian introduction is a deciduous member of the ginger family and grows from 2 to 4 feet tall. It is probably native to India, but has been cultivated throughout tropical Asia and the Pacific Islands. In Hawaii, it has become naturalized in areas of previous habitation. The root is used to treat earache, and nose and throat discomfort. \n<br><br>\n<b>Pia (Polynesian Arrowroot)/Taccaceae</b>\n<br>\nTacca family: This tuberous plant is a Polynesian introduction which has occasionally become naturalized in Hawaii. It is native to the Paleotropics from Western Africa through southeastern Asia, Malesia*, and northern Australia. The raw starch was used in water for diarrhea and when mixed with red clay for dysentery. The starch was also applied to wounds to stop bleeding.",
      "description" : "<b>A'ali'i (Hopseed Bush)/Sapindaceae</b>\n<br>\nSoapberry family : 'A'ali'i is indigenous to Hawaii and is found throughout the tropics and subtropics. It is an extremely variable plant and ranges in size from small shrubs to medium sized trees. 'A'ali'i occurs naturally from the coast into interior areas and at elevations from sea level to over 6500 ft. The leaves are used to treat rash, itches and other skin diseases. \n<br><br>\n<b>Awa (Kava)/Piperaceae</b>\n<br>\nPepper family: This medium sized shrub is a Polynesian introduction to Hawaii. It is probably indigenous to eastern Malesia*. The Hawaiians recognize a number of forms which are distinguished by stem color and shape, and by leaf size. The garden contains both green stem and black stem plants. The root is the part most often used in healing, but sometimes the bark and roots are used. It is used in the treatment of headaches, muscle pain, and to induce sleep. It is also a treatment for general debility, chills, colds and other lung problems, such as bronchitis and asthma. \n<br><br>\n<b>Awapuhi (Shampoo Ginger)/Zingiberaceae</b>\n<br>\nGinger family: A Polynesian introduction to Hawaii which has since naturalized, this ginger has long been cultivated in southeastern Asia and is possibly originally from India. 'Awapuhi is a deciduous herb which generally grows about two feet tall. Ashes of the leaves are used to treat cuts and sores. The root is used in the treatment of ringworm and sprains and bruises. The root is also used in treatment of headache, toothache and stomach ache. \n<br><br>\n<b>Kalo (Taro)/Araceae</b>\n<br>\nPhilodendron or Aroid family: Kalo is a perennial plant with large, distinctive leaves. Kalo is presumed to be native to India. It is cultivated throughout the tropics and was brought to Hawaii by the Polynesian settlers. It is the single most important plant in Hawaiian culture. The cut raw rootstock is rubbed on wounds to stop bleeding and the cut raw petiole is used to relieve the pain and prevent swelling of insect bites and stings. The corm is used to treat indigestion and as a laxative. The leaves are used in the treatment of asthma. Six Hawaiian kalo cultivars are being grown in the garden: poni, naioea, pi'iali'i, mananea, mana lau loa and mana 'ulu. The first four cultivars are listed in Outline of Hawaiian Physical Therapeutics by Handy, Pukui and Livermore (1934) as having been used specifically for healing.",
      "caption2" : "<b>Sources of water</b>\n<br>\nWater is the basic need in healing practices. The three layered design represents the three main sources of water in the environment. The bottom design represents the ocean as the first source of water. The central design represents the flowing movements of fresh water-sources on the land from rivers, streams and springs. The upper design represents water sources that come from the heavens in the form of rain. ",
      "caption" : "<b>Hoola</b>\n<br>\nThe outer rows of diamonds represents eyes. With the eyes, one has 'ike - sight. The word 'ike also means knowledge, therefore, the outer rows of diamonds represents the understanding and knowledge that healers attain in training.",

At one time, he had as many as 12 bands playing in the Islands. He not only promoted Hawaiian music in Hawaii, but on the mainland as well. But it was as a ukulele player that most remember Kaai. It was Johnny Noble, Hawaii's greatest composer, who said Kaai was \"Hawaii's greatest ukulele player\". Due to his musical ability, he is credited with making the ukulele into a featured instrument in Hawaiian groups.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br>Tiki parties or Luau parties...just got more fun with these cool Hawaiian instruments!<br>"

They represent a particular person's or couple's perception of an ideal tropical fantasy refuge. Some perceptions catalyzed the spirit of youth, romance or tranquility according to Thor. Others radiate adventure, living on the edge or an ultimate adult playground. Individual, yet sharing a common thread.\r\n\r\nI find there is a story in at least one of these paintings that a viewer will truly identify with. They envision themselves within the canvas portal actually living out a certain fantasy. \r\n\r\nThe paintings have many layers of experiences says Thor. There is the initial visual impact and response to colors or composition. Then there is the story behind the painting that draws the viewer closer into the picture where they can become part of that story. Again, there are the details to discover through the pieces that further support the story, believability and complexity of the image. \r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the viewer can create their own personal story behind the painting. I have seen many people personalize the art this way, interpreting symbols and details that illustrate their life and personality as they may choose in their perfect tropical place of refuge. As the artist, I see my own paintings a different way each time, after hearing the amazingly creative, touching, and personal interpretations collectors have shared with me over time.",

The goal of interior decoration is to provide a certain \" look and feel\" for the room; it can include hanging art pieces to the wall, painting walls and other surfaces, selecting pieces of furniture or art pieces, such as hand carved Tikis, surf signs, nautical wooden plaques, pirate artifacts, Tiki masks, TIki sculptures and more. In some cases, interior decorating is performed professionally by certified interior decorators (C.I.D.)\n<br><br>\nThe word <b>DECOR</b> could be often over used but we are living at a period of time where we put a lot of importance to home decor. Although the terminology interior decorating and interior design are sometimes used interchangeably, each discipline exhibits a distinct difference in its scope. Interior decorating is generally focused on the selection and presentation of interior items within a space, such as furniture, accessories, finishes and room layout. Interior design, on the other hand, involves manipulating the architectural integrity of the interior space."

They represent a particular person's or couple's perception of an ideal tropical fantasy refuge. Some perceptions catalyzed the spirit of youth, romance or tranquility according to Thor. Others radiate adventure, living on the edge or an ultimate adult playground. Individual, yet sharing a common thread.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI find there is a story in at least one of these paintings that a viewer will truly identify with. They envision themselves within the canvas portal actually living out a certain fantasy. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe paintings have many layers of experiences says Thor. There is the initial visual impact and response to colors or composition. Then there is the story behind the painting that draws the viewer closer into the picture where they can become part of that story. Again, there are the details to discover through the pieces that further support the story, believability and complexity of the image. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the viewer can create their own personal story behind the painting. I have seen many people personalize the art this way, interpreting symbols and details that illustrate their life and personality as they may choose in their perfect tropical place of refuge. As the artist, I see my own paintings a different way each time, after hearing the amazingly creative, touching, and personal interpretations collectors have shared with me over time.\r\n\r\n",

When Lopez got serious about surfing in high school, his hero was Paul Strauch -- his style and grace would be Lopezs reference point. At Ala Moana in the mid-60s, Lopez witnessed his first tuberides, and the wave became his training ground.\nDuring the epic winter of 1969-70, Lopez set the standard for riding the tube at the worlds most dangerous break. Suddenly, nothing else mattered in surfing. The barrel was now hallowed ground, and the barrel at Pipe was Shangri La."

They represent a particular person's or couple's perception of an ideal tropical fantasy refuge. Some perceptions catalyzed the spirit of youth, romance or tranquility according to Thor. Others radiate adventure, living on the edge or an ultimate adult playground. Individual, yet sharing a common thread.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI find there is a story in at least one of these paintings that a viewer will truly identify with. They envision themselves within the canvas portal actually living out a certain fantasy. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe paintings have many layers of experiences says Thor. There is the initial visual impact and response to colors or composition. Then there is the story behind the painting that draws the viewer closer into the picture where they can become part of that story. Again, there are the details to discover through the pieces that further support the story, believability and complexity of the image. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the viewer can create their own personal story behind the painting. I have seen many people personalize the art this way, interpreting symbols and details that illustrate their life and personality as they may choose in their perfect tropical place of refuge. As the artist, I see my own paintings a different way each time, after hearing the amazingly creative, touching, and personal interpretations collectors have shared with me over time.<br><br>\r\n \r\n"

At one time, he had as many as 12 bands playing in the Islands. He not only promoted Hawaiian music in Hawaii, but on the mainland as well. But it was as a ukulele player that most remember Kaai. It was Johnny Noble, Hawaii's greatest composer, who said Kaai was \"Hawaii's greatest ukulele player\".

It is said that at the time Kamehameha quartered his men at Kaunakakai on Molokai before the invasion of Oahu, he went to Lanai to celebrate the Makahiki (New Year) festival and on that occasion he said: We come to commemorate the spot where our ancestors first set foot on Hawaiian soil.

      "description" : "Prior to the arrival of the missionaries in 1820, Hawaiians believed in many gods. A Hawaiian chant, the Kumulipo which consists of 2102 lines, links the royal families to the gods.\n<br><br>\nThe four main gods were Kane, Ku, Lono and Kanaloa. Demi-gods included Pele and many others. Kane was the god of sunlight, fresh water, and natural life. Ku was the god of war and the male generating power. Lono was the god of peace, fertility, winds, rain and sports. Kanaloa was god of the ocean; Pele, the goddess of fire. The complexities of the relationships between all Hawaiian gods are explained in many legends. \n<br><br>\nEach Hawaiian family had its own aumakua (personal god) which protected them. For some it was the shark, others the pig, and so on. It was thought that spirits could communicate to the living through dreams and often appeared in the form of the family's aumakua.\n<br><br>\nThe Hawaiians built many heiau (temples) and placed offerings on specially constructed altar-like towers. Most offerings were edible and wrapped in ti leaves to keep the evil spirits away. Human sacrifice did occur but was not common. It was reserved for the war god Ku.<br>\nThe Hawaiian religion was greatly altered by the missionaries, yet strong beliefs did not die. In modern times a Hawaiian priest may bless a ground-breaking ceremony with a combination of Hawaiian chants and Christian prayers. The spirit of old Hawaii lives on.<br>\nOf the great gods worshiped throughout Polynesia, Ku, Kane, Lono and Kanaloa were named to the early missionaries. They are invoked together in chant, as in the lines: A distant place lying in quietness for Ku, for Lono, for Kane and Kanaloa.\n\n\n",

      "catdesc" : "<b>God Ku</b> \n<br>\nCreated by Na' wahine and Kane, and married to Hina. Ku and his manifestations, such as Ku-ka-ilimoku (Ku, the eater of islands -- the personal god of King Kamehameha,I) were brought to Hawaii by Pa'ao and when that happened, the original order was overthrown. When Ku became as the primary god of Hawaii (somewhere between 750, and 1250 A.D.), the balanced system where men and women were honored equally was overthrown. Today, Ku is the prevailing deity in the Heiau of Hawaii, and so women are not allowed on the platforms of the Heiau and are not allowed to make offerings. While we do not agree with the Kapu against women in today's current system, we respect the beliefs of the current Kapu system. The days of dishonor to women are over, however, and it is time to end that prohibition. Ku is Lord of the North Most people just know him as the god of war,\"... \"but Ku is so much more complex. He is the god of fishing, who built the first fishpond in Hana. He is the god of husbandry and farming, represented by the 'o'o , the digging stick, which penetrates the earth and makes it fertile. He is the god of war and conflict, but also of resolution and healing.\"\n<br><br>\n<b>God Lono</b>\n<br>\nIs the son of Na' wahine and Kane, and married to Laka. Lono is the god of learning, and intellect, and as Lono-i- ka-makahiki, is the god of the freedom of the end of the year. Lono has a number of aspects, such as Lono-makua who starts fire with a staff called pahoa. (In ancient times, the women did not start fires, men did, so the men cooked.) Lono is lord of the east.\n<br><br>\n<b>God Kane</b>\n<br>\nIo sent Mana across the Po, and created Kane, Io's son -- one of the creators of life on this earth. Kane was created, then Na' wahine was created. Keawe, Kane, and Na' wahine dwell together in the house of the sun (Hale a ka La). Kane is the primordial lord of the sun, and also appears in many different aspects which are personifications of natural phenomena such as Kane-hekili, the god of the thunder, and in the Taro root which, like Kane is purple. Kane is represented by an uncarved upright stone, since mankind cannot put form to the formless one. Kane is lord of the west.\n<br><br>\n<b>God Kanaloa</b>\n<br>\nSon of Na' wahine and Kane, and married to Tapo. Kanaloa is the ruler of the oceans, and consequently the ruler of the Mana. Kanaloa channels or funnels the Mana that comes from Io to Kane to Kanaloa. Since Kanaloa is the ruler of Mana, he is also invoked in some cases to alleviate or disperse disease (see the chant Pule Hee). Kanaloa is Lord of the South. When the Christian Missionaries arrived, they decided that Kanaloa was the devil, cast out of heaven. We do not believe that this was originally the case, since the Christian church has had a history of branding local deities as the devil, as for example, the god Pan in western Europe.",
      "meta_description" : "In the Hawaiian mythology, Hawaiians had four major Hawaiian Tiki gods: Ku (Tiki of strength also known as the war Tiki), Kanaloa (Tiki of the ocean), Kane (Tiki of abundance) and Lono (Tiki of learning).

      "description" : "== Hawaiian mythology ==\nOf the great gods worshiped throughout Polynesia, Ku, Kane, Lono and Kanaloa were named to the early missionaries. They are invoked together in chant, as in the lines: \nA distant place lying in quietness\nAccording to Kupihea the great gods came at different times to Hawaii. Ku and Hina, male and female, were the earliest gods of his people. Kane and Kanaloa came to Hawaii about the time of Maui. \n\n== Tiki Gods ==\n* Ku and Hina: male or husband (kane) and female or wife (wahine), are invoked as great ancestral gods of heaven and earth who have general control over the fruitfulness of earth and the generations of mankind. Ku means \"rising upright\", Hina means \"leaning down\". The sun at its rising is referred to Ku, the afternoon to Hina. Prayer is addressed to Ku toward the east, to Hina towards the west. Togetherthe two includes the whole earth and the heavens from east to west; in a symbol aslo they include the generations of mankind, both those are to come and those already born. Ku is the expression of the male generating power of the first parent by means of which the race is made fertile and reproduces from a single stock. Hina is the expression of female fecundity and the power of growth and production. The universal character of Ku as a god worship to produce good crops, good fishing, long life, and family and national prosperity for a whole people is illustrated in a prayer.<br>\n    God of the forest and of rain Ku: Kumokuhalii (Ku spreading over the land), Kupulupulu (Ku of the undergrowth), Kuolonowao (Ku of the deep forest), Kumauna (Ku of the mountain)<br>\n    God of husbandry: Kukaoo (Ku of the digging stick), Kukulia (Ku of dry farming), Kukeolowalu (Ku of wet farming)<br>\n    God of fishing: Kuula or Kuulakai (Ku of the abundance of the sea)<br>\n    God of war: Kunuiakea (Ku the supreme one), Kukailimoku (Ku snatcher of the island), Kukeoloewa (Ku the supporter), Kuho`one`ene`u (Ku pulling together the earth)<br>\n     God of the sorcery: Kuwahailo (Ku of the maggot-dropping mouth)\n* Tiki Lono in Hawaii is associated with cloud signs and the phenomena of storms. Lono as god of fertility was celebrated in the Makahiki festival held during the rainy season of the year. In prayers to Lono the signs of the god are named as thunder, lightning, earthquake, the dark cloud, the rainbow, rain and wind, whirlwinds that sweep the earth, rocks washed down the ravines by \"the red mountain streams rushing to the sea\", waterspouts, the clustering clouds of heaven, gushing springs on the mountains.\n* Tiki Kane: was the leading god among the great gods named by the Hawaiians at the time of the arrival of the missionaries in the islands. He represented the god of procreation and was worshiped as ancestor of chiefs and commoners.\n* Tiki Kanaloa is invokedby canoe men, Kane for the canoe building and Kanaloa for its sailing."

      "description" : "Welcome to our Hawaiian Koa jewelry collection: Koa is part of the Acacia family of trees and is recognized as one of the finest textured woods in the world. This native of Hawaii is truly a monarch of the forest, growing to heights of 100 feet. The best Koa (Acacia koa) can be found specifically on higher elevations of the Big Island and take 50 to 70 years to mature.\n   Different parts of the island yields a distinctive hue to the color of the wood. Currently the wood we use at Hawaiian Accessories is from Honakaa which has a dark red look. We also purchase wood from Hoonaunau in Kona which has an orange-brown color and wood harvested in Volcano, in the Puna district which has a lighter brown coloring.\n   In ancient Hawaii, Koa wood was harvested exclusively for the alii class or royalty. The huge logs were crafted into sculpted images of gods, personal containers and canoes for royalty. It is said that when the early Hawaiians wished to choose a Koa tree for a canoe, they found one which the elepaio bird had not been pecking.\n   By the turn of the century, koa was called the Hawaiian Mahogany and used extensively by the upper class and government buildings for furniture, staircases and other woodworks. Beautiful examples are still viewed in such places as the Iolani Palace.",

      "description" : "<b>Bamboo Fencing:</b><br><br>\nBamboo fencing is a unique and quite simple way to create divisions in your property or to give you privacy in your neighborhood.  Not only is bamboo great for using as a fence, but bamboo is also a great element to use ornately on gates, a patio, or within your landscaping.  If you have an already existing fence that needs a face lift, bamboo fencing is easily attachable to what you already have and saves you the time and money of taking down a preexisting structure.  Using shorter bamboo fencing is a great way to section off areas of your yard, but not totally separate areas from the whole of your yard.  Bamboo fencing creates an organic addition to your yard.  Traditional fencing materials such as metal or plastic stick out like a sore thumb in your yard, while bamboo fencing creates a natural flow throughout your yard.  You can even apply this same technique with bamboo fencing inside your house. \n"

      "description" : "<b>SHANE \"Tonu\" EAGLETON</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nArtist Biography & Project List\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shane Eagleton is a Polynesian master wood carver, environmental artist and educator. He is internationally renown with public art projects completed in England, New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, the Czech Republic, and the U.S. Shane has been based out of San Francisco, California for the last fifteen years (1987  2002)  and his work can be found in the Golden Gate National Parks, the San Francisco Zoo, Presidio National Park, the California Academy of Sciences, Golden Gate Park, and Shoreline Amphitheater. He has designed and carved stage art for touring bands Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, and Peter Gabriel. His wood sculptures have been featured at environmental, musical, and educational festivals around northern California, including Earth Day at the Concord Pavilion, the Bioneers Conference in San Francisco, and the United Religions Initiative Global Summit at Stanford University. Shane has been involved with various nonprofit organizations dedicated to recycling wood for its highest end use. Over the past eight years Shane was a director of the Bay Area Arborist Coop, Inc. specializing in the care of live trees in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has been working with live trees for over twenty years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n    Shane is originally from New Zealand and has traveled throughout the world doing his environmental artwork and educating people about the need to protect the Earth. Shanes Polynesian heritage comes from his mother who is from the island of Rotuma in the Fijian islands. His concern and care for all species is equal to his concern for the beauty and survival of indigenous communities around the world. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n    Over the past five years, Shane has served as the Artist-In-Residence for The Cultural Conservancy in San Francisco, where he works to preserve sustainable indigenous art traditions and use environmental art to educate people about the preciousness of the planet. Through Shanes ecologically-based sculptures, wood block prints, furniture, and healing poles, he communicates the importance of using natural products from the Earth that have been abandoned as waste. All of Shanes wood is salvaged from parks, dumps, and landfills. Through the restoration of indigenous wood carving traditions, Shane inspires communities to re-connect with their roots, protect endangered species and cultural traditions, and celebrate the mana (spiritual life force) that connects all things in the universe. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n    Since 2000, Shane has worked with at-risk youth from Monterey County, California at the former Ford Ord military base to teach basic wood carving skills and transform recycled cedar logs into life-size endangered animals and healing poles. Through the Monterey Workforce Board, Shane started the sculpture program of the One Voice Arts & Leadership Program of the One Stop Career Center of Monterey County. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n    In 2001, Shane re-located to the Windward side of Oahu, Hawaii where he teaches basic wood carving to youth and the general public at the Windward Community College (WCC), part of the University of Hawaii system. Shane recently worked with Hawaiian youth from the Alu Like Foundation and the Upward Bound Program teaching them to make drums and tikis. In Hawaii, Shane is developing the Pacific Cultural Institute for Trees and Wood Artisans, an educational center focused on salvaging discarded trees from Oahus green waste and recycling them into environmental and cultural art pieces.  In collaboration with other artists, teachers, youth, and community workers, Shane is planning to create a state-of-the-art international institute. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n    In the summer of 2002, Shane worked in Monterey County for the One Voice Arts & Leadership Program, teaching youth how to carve wood and complete two special healing poles. One of these poles was gifted to the Bronx Zoo in New York on behalf of the Monterey County Workforce Board as a memorial to the people who perished at the World Trade Center. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n    This October, Shane will create the main stage art for the Bioneers Conference in San Rafael, California and his artwork will be featured at the Cultural Conservancy booth. A silent auction of the Bioneers stage art will be done as a fundraiser for The Cultural Conservancy and the Bioneers Conference. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n    In the second half of October, Shane will be the Artist-In-Residence at the Bay Area Discovery Museum in Sausalito, California, where he will carve a redwood canoe and conduct workshops with children, the museum staff, and the public.\r\n\r\n  <br><br>\r\n\r\nHighlights from Past Projects (a partial list)\r\n<br>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>In 1992:</b><br>\r\n\r\nShane carved a Rock for Life Healing Pole, in Czechoslovakia. This pole was carved for a rock concert benefit for cancer research for children. \r\n\r\n  <br><br>\r\n\r\nBill Graham Presents commissioned Shane to carve a Healing Pole to dedicate to the indigenous peoples of America. The pole stands at Shoreline Amphitheater, Mountain View, California and is viewed by thousands each week. \r\n\r\n  <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>In 1993:</b><br>\r\n\r\nShane carved a 33-foot redwood tree as a tribute to endangered and extinct species for Peter Gabriels World of Music and Dance (WOMAD) concert in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. The event was attended by over 100,000 people and an estimated 15,000 people made rubbings from the pole during this one-day event. \r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>In 1996:</b><br>\r\n\r\nShane collaborated with the poet Laureate Robert Haas for the Watershed Festival to create the installation River of Words which toured around the country. The purpose of this art project was to have people interact with poetry carved into recycled wood and learn about the interface of nature and poetry. \r\n\r\n  <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>In 1997:</b><br>\r\n\r\nWith The Cultural Conservancy and other nonprofit organizations, Shane developed the Kohola Project and organized a public ceremony on Crissy Field in the Presidio National Park to honor the local indigenous peoples, the Ohlone, by gifting them with a 35 foot salvaged yellow cedar Healing Pole carved by Shane. \r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>In 1998:</b><br>\r\n\r\nGGNRA Superintendent Brian ONeill presented Kofi Annan, UN Secretary-General, a wooden sculpture from a piece of cedar recycled from a Presidio barrack as a gift from Golden Gate National Parks. Shane also carved a sculpture of the continent of Africa with a lion on it for Nelson Mandela and the African Summit. \r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>In 1999:</b><br>\r\n\r\nShane worked with a group of English youth-at-risk in northern England to teach them how to use wood and tools and to create a special community place resembling Stonehedge (a Woodhenge) using recycled English hardwoods. \r\n\r\n  <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>In 2000:</b><br>\r\n\r\nFrom 2000 to 2002 Shane worked with the Monterey Arts and Leadership Program at Fort Ord, Monterey, California, teaching at-risk youth how to carve wood and create environmental art. In the summer\r\nof 2002 Shane and his students carved a special Healing Pole as a gift to the people of New York City, in honor of the September 11, 2001 tragedy. For more information about this New York healing\r\npole and its journey, see:\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Local Teens Make Pole to Heal\"\r\nHealing Pole heading for NYC\r\nSept 11 Gift to NYC\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>In 2001:</b><br>\r\n\r\nShanes wood block prints and a whale healing pole were featured at Lanuola, the Colors of Life, the 1st Annual Pacific Islanders Art Exhibit at the SomARTS Cultural Center in San Francisco. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>In 2002:</b><br>\r\nAlthough now based in Hawaii, Shane continues to work on the mainland and in his old home in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the fall of 2002, TCC sponsored Shane Eagletons artist residency at the\r\nBay Area Discovery Museum (www.badm.org). Shane taught young children how to sculpt with clay, and carved a beautiful childrens fantasy canoe out of recycled redwood log (photo). See the article:<br>\r\n\r\n\"Reshaping Tradition\" -Nov. 02-\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Fall/Winter of 2002, the Greenwood School of Mill Valley, California sponsored a special art show and sale of Shanes animal sculptures. During this time Shane also made a presentation to the schools faculty and student body about Indigenous and Environmental Art\r\n\r\n  \r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>In 2003:</b><br>\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2002 and 2003, Shane carved two special Woodfish\r\nAwards (four carved fish out of recycled Hawaiian hardwood) as part of the new and annual Woodfish Prize created by Dr. Leslie Gray of the Woodfish Institute www.woodfish.org to honor a Native American and a Euro-American who collaborate on a social action project that is mutually transformative. This is now a new annual tradition and if you are interested in applying for this Award, please see the Woodfish Institute web site. This award is also co-sponsored by the Association for Transpersonal Psychology. \r\n<br><br>\r\nCurrently, Shane is setting up his wood carving teaching studio at the Lolani Building at the UH Windward Campus in preperation for full-timeteaching with Hawaiian youth this fall. He is also creating art for the Bioneers Conference in October, and teaching community evening classes at the Honolulu Zoo. Shane is excited to be living in Hawaii, working with the mana of the trees, the aina, and his ancestors. Its great to be living and working with my Polynesian ohana again.    <br><br>\r\n"

This concept was popularized through tourism between the Hawaiian Islands and the continental United States in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nChildren and sweethearts are poetically referred to as \"lei\" and many ancient and modern songs and chants refer to this imagery.\nPolynesian\nIn Polynesian cultures, a lei is something that is created by someone and given to another with the intent to decorate that person for an emotional reasonusually as a sign of affection. Common reasons include greeting, farewell, affection or love, friendship, appreciation, congratulation, recognition, or to otherwise draw attention to the recipient.

      "description" : "<b>MAORI TATTOO</b>\n<br>\nAmong the Maori, tattooing is a very meaningful, common, and sacred form of art. The Maori believe that Mataora was responsible for bringing Moko (tattooing) to the world as a symbol of love and commitment for his wife, Niwareka. By enduring the tremendous pain of the tattoo, Mataora proved to his father-in-law, Uetonga, that he was worthy of continuing his relationship with Niwareka. As a result of this experience, Mataora also learned the art of applying the Moko. \n<br><br>\n<b>MOKO MEANING</b>\n<br>\nThis story illustrates the sacred and godly spirit that Moko holds. Each Moko holds an ancestral or tribal message that is unique to the wearer. The messages narrate a wearers family, tribal and sub-tribal affiliations and their placed within these social structures. The placing of the Moko shows the wearers value or position in society by way of bloodlines or through qualification. Moko was used as a tool by which a hierarchical custom could be observed and maintained. \n<br><br>\n<b>KORU: SPIRAL DESIGN</b>\n<br>\nThe koru, or spiral design, is the most used element in Moko. A Maori proverb says, \"Ka hinga atu he tete-kura - ka hara-mai he tete-kura. Translated this means, \"As one fern frond (person) dies - one is born to take its place\". The primary meaning of the koru is \"birth,\" \"re-growth\" and \"re-generation.\" It is an analogy of what Koru can represent. Coupled with the human characteristics, as previously explained, we can see that as one supports the other, it is safe to assume that koru represents or personifies actual ancestors. With this in mind we can also assume that single Koru with secondary protrusions growing from it symbolizes parenthood, or whakapapa (ancestry/genealogy). It also symbolizes sustainability; the passing of life, information and resources from one generation to the next. For double headed Koru, known as Mango Pare, most Maori artists will tell you that this design pertains to the warrior. This double headed \"analogy\" takes its form from the Hammerhead Shark. A symbol of strength and ferocity that best fits the warrior and the attitude required to be successful in that occupation. It is no wonder that Koru, with such comprehensive and important meanings, should dominate Moko.\n"

      "description" : "<b>Bamboo Dcor</b><br><br>\nBamboo is an excellent way to add an organic vibe with pure elegance to any home.  Bamboo can be used both inside and outside.  Bamboo is not only beautiful, but it is also easy to maintain, and easy on the earth!\n<br><br>\nAccording to the laws of Feng Shui, luck and prosperity will be an addition to your home when you use bamboo as a decorating element.  When using bamboo inside your home, try adding it to already existing foliage and/or flowers, or go all out and create a unique arrangement with just bamboo.  Using bamboo of different lengths in a large, ornate pot, with up lighting, can create a simple, yet sophisticated Eastern Asian piece of art decor.  Another creative way to use bamboo indoors, is as a chair rail along your walls.  Splice medium to large bamboo down the center and adhere horizontally to the lower half of your wall.  This will create a very tropical feel to any room.  If you need to separate a large room into smaller section, try using 3-4 foot tall bamboo fencing to section off the areas needed.\n<br><br>\nBamboo also makes a design statement when used outdoors.  If you need to create a barrier, either from a neighbor, pool, or perhaps a garden or childrens play area, try using bamboo as your medium of separation.  Bamboo is easily attachable to already existing fences that need a face lift, or bamboo can be used on its own to create separation.  Bamboo works much better than traditional plastic, metal or vinyl fencing because of its natural look and feel.  Youll notice how your landscaping pops around bamboo.  \n"

Tapa is considered one of the greatest gifts to give or receive on occasions such as wedding, funerals, birthdays or births.  Tapa has high monetary value and can be used for bartering goods or as loan collateral.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSoft white Tapa may be used to wrap newborns babies.  Painted Tapa may be used to dress up a bride on her wedding day, or laid out for royalty to walk on, or simply as a blanket on cool nights.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTapa is made from the bark of the mulberry tree.  When first harvest, the bark measures 1/8 to a 1/4 of an inch thick and 4 inches wide.  This is then pummeled by hand with a wooded mallet until the bark is paper-thin and 12-18 inches wide.  Each piece is then glued together using paste made from the tapioca root, making a finished large piece that can measure 100 X 30 feet.  Tapa is painted with natural dye made from various trees producing different hues.  Each island has distinctive dye and designs creating different styles of Tapa.\r\n"

The lower face is fairly easy, the higher one will be a little more challenging hanging on the ladder...\n<br>\nThe challenge of course was to be able to carve on the ladder while manipulating the chainsaw!\n<br>\nUpon, completion we decided to add Pele's hair to the 2 Tiki totems!

The flat part of the blade is used as a shield, and the weapon is used like a club, with the added cutting ability of shark teeth.\n<br><br>\nIf possible, female shark teeth were used because they were hollow, and poison could be placed inside them for an added lethal touch to this devastating weapon. The action of the teeth also allow it to be used in a saw-like fashion to cut and tear flesh moving forward or backward.\n<br><br>\nMany types of Shark Tooth Clubs exist in the Lua. Most have a solid, straight frame with a circular or oblong head, others are open framed with a straight handle and still yet an open framed version with a curved handle similar to a large brass knucle.\n<br><br>\nShark Teeth were also attached to strangling cords. The cords are typically a five cord braid with the teeth set between the cords and embedded in bark cloth or fiber for stiffness.\n",

Each club has a specific use and targets a specific part of the body.<br><br>\nOur collection of authentic Polynesian wooden sculptures are carved with the best materials available.

This Tiki Ku measures about 12 feet tall and was carved from a single log of Monkey Pod aging over 100 years old.  The tree had to be taken down which came from the zoo in Waikiki, luckily we were able to salvage most of it and turn it into a great art piece.  The Tiki was sold almost immediately after its creation.  The Tiki Ku will be residing on Maui at an undisclosed location overlooking and protecting facing North.  <br><br>\r\nOur Tiki carvers hand chiseled the entire Tiki, you can see from the picture the attention to details.  The most challenging is to move the Tiki, heavy equipement is a must and above all the techniques to move it is crucial.",
